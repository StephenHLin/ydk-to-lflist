Prerequistes - Python

Instructions:
1. Place 'main.py' and 'run.bat' in a folder that also contains your .ydk files
2. Run 'run.bat', you will be prompt for your deck's file name. Type it in and press enter. (don't include extensions)
3. A .lflist file (whitelist file) should be generated. Place this in your client's banlist folders (e.g. Projectignis/repositories/lflists)
4. Open the deck builder client, load the 'AFKyle Seasons' banlist. The filters should only show cards you have in your collection now.
