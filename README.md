# ydk-to-lflist
Converts a ydk deck list into a whitelist for EDOpro

# How to Use
1. Place `ydkconverter.py` and `run.bat` in the folder containing your `.ydk` file
2. Execute `run.bat` and enter your deck/collection's file name when prompt (don't include extensions)
3. Place the generated `.lflist` file in your EDOpro's banlist folder (e.g. `/Ignisproject/repositories/lflist`)
4. In the Deckbuilder client, choose 'AFKyle Seasons'. Now the deckbuilder will filter and only show cards you have in your collection.
